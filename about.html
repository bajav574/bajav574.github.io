            Like dancing and painting, football is a form of art.  It largely fueled my passion for art and is a cardinal factor  in my decision to pursue graphic design. I spent long hours meticulously designing posters of my favorite football players  and sharing them with fellow enthusiasts. My first step into the world of graphic design was when I launched my own online  poster shop in my hometown of Mumbai.
